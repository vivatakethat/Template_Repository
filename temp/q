       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d utility shall cause the shell to treat the arguments  as  a
       simple command, suppressing the shell function lookup that is described
       in _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _2_._9_._1_._1, _C_o_m_m_a_n_d _S_e_a_r_c_h _a_n_d _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n, item 1b.

       The  order  for  command  search  allows  functions to override regular
       built-ins and path searches. This utility is necessary to  allow  func‐
       tions that have the same name as a utility to call the utility (instead
       of a recursive call to the function).

       The system default path is available using _g_e_t_c_o_n_f; however, since _g_e_t_‐
       _c_o_n_f  may  need to have the _P_A_T_H set up before it can be called itself,
       the following can be used:

           ccoommmmaanndd −−pp ggeettccoonnff PPAATTHH

       There are some advantages to suppressing the special characteristics of
       special built-ins on occasion. For example:

           ccoommmmaanndd eexxeecc >> _u_n_w_r_i_t_a_b_l_e_-_f_i_l_e

       does  not  cause  a non-interactive script to abort, so that the output
       status can be checked by the script.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, _e_n_v, _n_o_h_u_p, _t_i_m_e, and _x_a_r_g_s utilities have been  specified
       to  use  exit code 127 if an error occurs so that applications can dis‐
       tinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from  ``invoked  utility  exited
       with  an error indication''. The value 127 was chosen because it is not
       commonly used for other meanings; most utilities use small  values  for
       ``normal  error  conditions''  and the values above 128 can be confused
       with termination due to receipt of a signal. The value 126  was  chosen
       in  a  similar  manner to indicate that the utility could be found, but
       not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages differenti‐
       ating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
       127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all  attempts  to
       _e_x_e_c  the  utility fail with [[EENNOOEENNTT]], and uses 126 when any attempt to
       _e_x_e_c the utility fails for any other reason.

       Since the −−vv and −−VV options of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d produce output  in  relation  to
       the  current shell execution environment, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is generally provided
       as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a subshell or  separate
       utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           ((PPAATTHH==ffoooo ccoommmmaanndd −−vv))
            nnoohhuupp ccoommmmaanndd −−vv

       it  does  not  necessarily  produce  correct results. For example, when
       called with _n_o_h_u_p or an _e_x_e_c function, in a separate utility  execution
       environment,  most  implementations  are  not able to identify aliases,
       functions, or special built-ins.

       Two types of regular built-ins could be encountered  on  a  system  and
       these  are described separately by _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The description of command
       search in _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _2_._9_._1_._1, _C_o_m_m_a_n_d _S_e_a_r_c_h _a_n_d _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n  allows  for  a
       standard  utility to be implemented as a regular built-in as long as it
       is found in the appropriate place in a _P_A_T_H search.  So,  for  example,
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  −−vv  _t_r_u_e might yield //bbiinn//ttrruuee or some similar pathname. Other
       implementation-defined utilities that are not defined by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 might exist only as built-ins and have no pathname associ‐
       ated with them. These produce output identified as (regular) built-ins.
       Applications  encountering these are not able to count on _e_x_e_cing them,
       using them with _n_o_h_u_p, overriding them with a different  _P_A_T_H,  and  so
       on.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
        1. Make  a version of _c_d that always prints out the new working direc‐
           tory exactly once:

               ccdd(()) {{
                   ccoommmmaanndd ccdd ""$$@@"" >>//ddeevv//nnuullll
                   ppwwdd
               }}

        2. Start off a ``secure shell script'' in which the script avoids  be‐
           ing spoofed by its parent:

               IIFFSS==''
               ''
               ##    TThhee pprreecceeddiinngg vvaalluuee sshhoouulldd bbee <<ssppaaccee>><<ttaabb>><<nneewwlliinnee>>..
               ##    SSeett IIFFSS ttoo iittss ddeeffaauulltt vvaalluuee..

               \unalias −a
               #    Unset all possible aliases.
               #    Note that unalias is escaped to prevent an alias
               #    being used for unalias.

               unset −f command
               #    Ensure command is not a user function.

               PATH="$(command −p getconf PATH):$PATH"
               #    Put on a reliable PATH prefix.

               #    ...

           At  this point, given correct permissions on the directories called
           by _P_A_T_H, the script has the ability to ensure that any  utility  it
           calls is the intended one. It is being very cautious because it as‐
           sumes that implementation extensions may be present that would  al‐
           low  user functions to exist when it is invoked; this capability is
           not specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, but it is not prohib‐
           ited  as  an  extension. For example, the _E_N_V variable precedes the
           invocation of the script with a user start-up script. Such a script
           could define functions to spoof the application.

       Since _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is a regular built-in utility it is always found prior to
       the _P_A_T_H search.

       There is nothing in the description of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d that implies the command
       line  is  parsed any differently from that of any other simple command.
       For example:

           ccoommmmaanndd aa || bb ;; cc

       is not parsed in any special way that causes ''||'' or '';;'' to  be  treated
       other  than  a  pipe  operator or <semicolon> or that prevents function
       lookup on bb or cc.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d utility is somewhat similar to  the  Eighth  Edition  shell
       _b_u_i_l_t_i_n  command,  but  since  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  also goes to the file system to
       search for utilities, the name _b_u_i_l_t_i_n would not be intuitive.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d utility is most likely to be provided as a  regular  built-
       in. It is not listed as a special built-in for the following reasons:

        *  The  removal of exportable functions made the special precedence of
           a special built-in unnecessary.

        *  A special built-in has special properties (see _S_e_c_t_i_o_n  _2_._1_4,  _S_p_e_‐
           _c_i_a_l _B_u_i_l_t_-_I_n _U_t_i_l_i_t_i_e_s) that were inappropriate for invoking other
           utilities. For example, two commands such as:

               ddaattee >> _u_n_w_r_i_t_a_b_l_e_-_f_i_l_e

               command date > _u_n_w_r_i_t_a_b_l_e_-_f_i_l_e

           would have entirely different results; in a non-interactive script,
           the  former  would continue to execute the next command, the latter
           would abort. Introducing this semantic difference along  with  sup‐
           pressing functions was seen to be non-intuitive.

       The  −−pp  option  is present because it is useful to be able to ensure a
       safe path search that finds all the  standard  utilities.  This  search
       might  not  be identical to the one that occurs through one of the _e_x_e_c
       functions (as defined in the System Interfaces volume of  POSIX.1‐2008)
       when  _P_A_T_H is unset. At the very least, this feature is required to al‐
       low the script to access the correct version of  _g_e_t_c_o_n_f  so  that  the
       value of the default path can be accurately retrieved.

       The  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  −−vv and −−VV options were added to satisfy requirements from
       users that are currently accomplished  by  three  different  historical
       utilities:  _t_y_p_e  in  the  System V shell, _w_h_e_n_c_e in the KornShell, and
       _w_h_i_c_h in the C shell. Since there is no historical agreement on how and
       what to accomplish here, the POSIX _c_o_m_m_a_n_d utility was enhanced and the
       historical utilities were left unmodified.  The C  shell  _w_h_i_c_h  merely
       conducts a path search. The KornShell _w_h_e_n_c_e is more elaborate—in addi‐
       tion to the categories required by POSIX, it also  reports  on  tracked
       aliases, exported aliases, and undefined functions.

       The output format of −−VV was left mostly unspecified because human users
       are its only audience.  Applications should  not  be  written  to  care
       about  this information; they can use the output of −−vv to differentiate
       between various types of commands, but the additional information  that
       may  be  emitted by the more verbose −−VV is not needed and should not be
       arbitrarily constrained in its verbosity or localization  for  applica‐
       tion parsing reasons.
